ingredients {

500 grams of polvilho, # One of many types of cassava flour, often translated as tapioca starch or manioc starch. 

## You can find polvilho in Brazilian/Latin markets and online. It may be tricky to buy the right type, but here's one example: https://www.amazon.com/Sour-Starch-Polvilho-Azedo-GLUTEN/dp/B005CBRPIW/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=polvilho+azedo&qid=1567547992&s=grocery&sr=1-3

1/2 cup (120 ml) of oil, # Canola works well.

1 cup (240 ml) of milk, # I've used whole milk only.

200 grams of Mexican queso fresco or a similar fresh white cheese, # See notes below on saltiness.

140 grams of shredded Parmesan cheese, # Would probably work with grated Parmesan as well.

2 eggs,

1 spoon of salt. # Careful here - see notes below.

} # End of ingredients.

## I've used farmer's cheese instead of Mexican queso fresco, but if you use that you may want to add more salt to the batter. Queso fresco is very salty, so be careful. It's always a good idea to taste the batter before adding more salt.
 
preparation {

Boil the oil and the milk together in a pot on low fire, # Mix with a spoon every now and then as you go. It will take only a minute to boil, so keep an eye.

Add the polvilho (flour) to a large bow and pour the oil + milk on top, # Mix well as you pour.

Add the eggs to the batter, # Mix well as you pour.

Crumble the queso fresco with your hands before adding to the batter,

Add the cheese (both types) to the batter, # Mix well.

## At this point, you may feel like the mix is a bit dry, but it's hardly necessary to add more liquid.

## You may want to cool down the batter in the freezer for a bit. It will make the batter firmer and easier to make balls.

Pour a drop of oil on your hands (to avoid sticking) and start making balls,

## You can make the balls the size you want. I like medium-sized. This script should make about 30 medium cheese balls depending on your system configurations.

Spread some butter on a tray and place the balls on the tray, # Butter not needed if you have one of those anti-sticking baking layers.

Bake at 400 F for 15-20 min, # May need 25 min if the balls are closer to each other and depending on system specifications.

Try to wait until it cools down a bit so you can actually enjoy the flavor. # This step may be harder than you think.

## Important: You may have to add more polvilho or salt depending on the cheese. It takes a couple tries to get the right amounts of each ingredients for perfect consistency. However, PdQ is usually delicious regardless.

} # End of preparation.

## Done.

## Enjoy and let me know if you have questions!
